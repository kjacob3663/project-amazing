/**
The class RecursiveStrategy provides the Template Methods for the classes Kruskal and RecursiveBacktracker.
The methods setUpStructure() and basicMode() are shared among Kruskal and RecursiveBacktracker and therefore implemented.
The methods huntMode() and handleCases() differ and therefore remain abstract here.
